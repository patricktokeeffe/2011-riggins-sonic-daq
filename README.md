Sonic anemometer data acquisition (DAQFactory)
==============================================

Riggins, ID (2011)
------------------

No-frills high-frequency (~10Hz) data acquisition for Applied Technologies, Inc
(ATI) sonic anemometer. Used summer 2011 near Riggins, Idaho.

### Requirements

* [DAQFactory](http://azeotech.com)
* the project file, `ATI Sonic in DAQFactory.ctl`
* the instrument driver, `pATI.ddp`

### Installation

Place a copy of the anemometer driver, `pATI.ddp`, in the root of the
DAQFactory installation (typ. C:\DAQFactory\). The next time DAQFactory is
started, it will have a new instrument listing for the sonic anemometer.

### Getting started

*Sorry, I no longer have DAQFactory installed so this will have to remain TODO.
But you are a bright person and since it's DAQFactory there is a nice, labelled
graphical interface so go on without me - you'll do fine.*
